% ----------------------- SOBOLEV GRADIENT SMOOTHING OPTIONS ----------------------%
%
% Activate the gradient smoothing solver for the discrete adjoint driver (NO, YES)
% this will run the Sobolev gradient smoothing solver as an additional postprocessing step
% to the derivative projections in SU2_DOT_AD.
% The method requires the AD mode to be active.
SMOOTH_GRADIENT= YES
%
% Mode how the Sobolev method is applied to the sensitivities.
% - NONE                  (Default option if none is choosen, does nothing.)
% - PARAM_LEVEL_COMPLETE  (Apply Sobolev smoothing to the projected gradient, w.r.t. the design values.)
% - MESH_LEVEL            (Apply Sobolev smoothing to the mesh sensitivities, either in the volume or on the surface.)
% - DEBUG                 (Flag to test the finite elements asembly of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.)
% - ONLY_GRADIENT         (Use the smoothing solver to calculate the unaltered gradient.)

SMOOTHING_EPSILON2= 0.625
%
% Switch for applying the Sobolev smoothing to the design surface mesh, i.e., instead of the whole volume mesh (NO, YES).
SMOOTH_ON_SURFACE= YES
%
% Switch for applying the solver to each space dimension of the meshsensitivity seperately.
% Only works with SOBOLEV_MODE=MESH_LEVEL.
SEPARATE_DIMENSIONS= NO
%
% Use Dirichlet boundary conditions when working on the design surface.
% Calculates the edge nodes of the design surface and sets the meshsensitivity there =0.
% Only used for SMOOTH_ON_SURFACE= YES .
DIRICHLET_SURFACE_BOUNDARY= NO
%
% For smoothing meshsensitivities in the volume mesh, the Laplace-Beltrami operator is applied with 0 Neumann boundary by default.
% Dirichlet boundary conditions can be used by adding boundary markes to MARKER_SOBOLEVBC. The meshsensitivities will be set to 0,
% i.e. zero Dirichlet boundaries for this marker.

% Therefore, he settings here are used to compute the adjoint mesh movement.
