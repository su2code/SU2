% Intro:
% PaStiX is a direct sparse solver, its main application in SU2 is to
% elasticity problems (especially stiff ones).
% You can use it for fluid problems for example to run at high CFL,
% but for 3D cases of moderate size (~500k) the computational cost is
% going to be prohibitive (2D is fine up to several million nodes).
% Note: Steady state discrete adjoints only require 1 factorization...
% This file explains the available options, for build instructions
% see the accompanying readme.txt file.
%
% Factorization types:
% LDL^T, self-adjoint systems, option PASTIX_LDLT
% LU, general systems, double the time/memory, option PASTIX_LU
% ILU, incomplete LU that accounts for halo points, option PASTIX_ILU
%
% LDL^T and LU can be used as linear solvers e.g.
LINEAR_SOLVER= PASTIX_LDLT
LINEAR_SOLVER_PREC= LU_SGS % or JACOBI to save on memory
% or as preconditioners
DISCADJ_LIN_PREC= PASTIX_ILU
DISCADJ_LIN_SOLVER= "any iterative solver"
% ILU can only be used as preconditioner, its level of fill is set via
PASTIX_FILL_LEVEL= 1 % integer option
%
% The purpose of using full factorizations as preconditioners is to either
% achieve lower linear solver residuals, or to reduce the cost by avoiding
% recomputation of the factorization on every nonlinear iteration (the
% factorization becomes approximate and so refinement is needed).
% This is set via
PASTIX_FACTORIZATION_FREQUENCY= 1 % 0 means "only on first iteration"
%
% By default the solver runs silently, more verbosity can be set via
PASTIX_VERBOSITY_LEVEL= 0 % - Silent
% 1 - On factorization, solves, and cleanup; 2 - Same with more detail.
