% Optimization
% "Classic" density approach to topology optimization. Each element is
% assigned a density variable that is used to penalize its stiffness.
TOPOLOGY_OPTIMIZATION= YES
% The element design densities (0 <= rho <= 1) come from the 6th column of
% this file, those are the variables the optimizer should manipulate.
% Values below 0 or above 1 will result in density of 0 or 1 respectively,
% i.e. the value after filtering is ignored.
FEA_FILENAME= element_properties.dat
% Filtering is required to avoid numerical issues, see [Sigmund, 2007]
% (DOI 10.1007/s00158-006-0087-x). Currently available options:
% CONSTANT;  CONICAL (default);  GAUSSIAN;  DILATE;  ERODE.
% The filter can have multiple sequential stages (2 in this case).
TOPOL_OPTIM_FILTER_KERNEL= ( DILATE,ERODE )
% Each kernel can have its own radius (R1, R2, ...) or one value can be
% specified for all.
TOPOL_OPTIM_FILTER_RADIUS= 0.01
% The filtering may become very expensive if the mesh has very refined
% regions. If different from 0 this option mitigates that by limiting the
% "logical radius" (for immediate neighbors that radius is 1, etc.).
TOPOL_OPTIM_SEARCH_LIMIT= 0
% The Gaussian, Erode, and Dilate filters, have a constant parameter.
% Again this can be a list.
TOPOL_OPTIM_KERNEL_PARAM= 200
% After the filtering, a projection step can be applied to increase the
% solid-void contrast, i.e. the discreteness of the solution. Options:
% NO_PROJECTION (default);  HEAVISIDE_UP;  HEAVISIDE_DOWN.
TOPOL_OPTIM_PROJECTION_TYPE= NO_PROJECTION
% The continuous Heaviside function (step) approximations require a
% parameter, large value equals more discrete.
TOPOL_OPTIM_PROJECTION_PARAM= 0
% The penalization exponent for the Simplified Isotropic Material with
% Penalization.
TOPOL_OPTIM_SIMP_EXPONENT= 3.0
% The stiffness of void elements (normalized by ELASTICITY_MODULUS)
TOPOL_OPTIM_SIMP_MINSTIFF= 0.001
% Output file for the derivatives of the OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION w.r.t. the
% design densities.

% Relevant options:
% - TOPOL_COMPLIANCE:   Work of forces [J];
% - VOLUME_FRACTION:    Volume average of rho, 1 means totally solid;
% - TOPOL_DISCRETENESS: Volume average of 4*rho*(1-rho),
%                       0 means perfect solid-void topology.
% - STRESS_PENALTY:     KS-aggregated maximum element-average VM stress,
%                       use it as a <= 0 constraint.
% REFERENCE_NODE can be used in lieu of compliance for simple load cases.
