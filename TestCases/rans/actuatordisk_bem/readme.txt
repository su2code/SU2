Propeller data provided as the test case here is the propeller used in the studies of Sinnige et al. 2018 in their experimental studies. Isolated propeller geometry as .stp file and experimental results (J vs CT, J vs CP) are provided as supplementary materials along with the publication.

The current test case corresponds to the four bladed propeller of diameter 0.237m in a freestream velocity (Vinf) of 40m/s, advance ratio of J=0.8, propeller blade angle at 0.75R is 23.9 degrees.

The experimental thrust and power (Non-Dimensional) at J ~ 0.8 are as follows:

J=Vinf/nD	CT=Thrust/rho*n2*D4	CP=Power/rho*n3*D5
0.7963	            0.0953	              0.1025

The dimensional values are Thrust = 16.30 N and Torque = 0.6612 N-m.
