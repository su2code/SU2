This README file includes instructions on how to use Eclipse with the SU2
github repository. It is assumed that Eclipse has already been installed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Initial Eclipse Set-up
In order to view files with helpful text highlighting and code navigation
tools, install the packages for C++, Python, and Git:
	Help -> Install New Software
	Install packages for Git, C++ and Python, for example:
		C/C++ Development Tools SDK
		Eclipse EGit
		PyDev for Eclipse

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Get the code

2a.If you have already cloned the SU2 source code, or prefer to clone via the
command line, you will need to import this project into the Eclipse Workspace:
	File -> New -> Makefile project with existing code
	Name the project and navigate to the appropriate directory.
	Make sure "C++" is checked and select "finish"

2b. To clone the repository to your local system using Eclipse tools:
	Switch to the Git perspective:
		Window -> open perspective -> Git Repository Exploring
	Use Eclipse to clone th repository:
		"Clone a Git Repository and add the clone to this view"
		Select "URI"
		Select the "git" protocol
		Type "github.com" in the Host field
		Type "su2code/SU2" in the Repository Path field.
		Select "Next"
		Select branches to clone and select "next"
		Select the destination directory, initial branch, etc
		Select "Finish"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. View the branch structure and use Eclipse git tools:
If you did not clone the repository using Egit:
	Window -> open perspective -> Git Repository Exploring
	Window -> Show View -> Git Repositories
	Add the repository:
	In the Git repositories window, select "add an existing local git
	repository to this view".
	Browse to the location where you cloned the repository, select "finish"

	When in the Git perspective, you will be able to see your local github
	repositories and graphically explore the branch structure.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Viewing and Editting the code:
	Select Wndow -> open perspectives -> C/C++
	If the C/C++ projects view does not open automatically:
		Select Window -> show view -> C/C++ Projects
	Select Project-> Properties to edit Eclipse behavior

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
