 * \mainpage SU2 version 8.2.0 "Harrier"
 * SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software tools
 * to perform PDE analysis and PDE constrained optimization.  The toolset is designed with
 * computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to
 * include other families of governing equations such as potential flow, electrodynamics, chemically reacting
 * flows, and many others.  SU2 is released under an open-source license.
 *
 * The following technical documentation describes the structure and details of the source code for developers.
 * Each module groups classes and functions dedicated to major areas or features of the code base.
 * This documentation helps awnsering questions such as
 * - What are the major classes of the code (architecture)?
 * - How do those classes interact with each other?
 * - What low-level functionality is already implemented that can be re-used?
 *
 * Given the use of polymorphism in SU2, it is usefull to start studying each module from the base class
 * (which usually has a generic name), this will show the inheritance diagram for that family. Moreover,
 * many important functions (defining the interactions between families) are implemented at the base level,
 * the "call graph" of a function will show these interactions (derived classes only specialize certain details).
 * Alternatively, "caller graphs" can be used to navigate to the larger classes that use smaller ones, and
 * thus navigate the architecture from the bottom up (note that this will also be more effective if done
 * for base classes).
 *
 * ### Good practices when documenting classes and functions
 *
 * The groups and subgroups defined in this file form a hierarchy of doxygen modules, when documenting a
 * class or free function it should be added to a group (member functions belong to the group of the class
 * by default), otherwise it will be difficult to navigate to the documentation of the class or function.
 * Therefore, all classes and functions should have a doxygen documentation block with at least \\brief and
 * \\ingroup properties.
 *
 * Note that this is a work in progress and not all classes and functions are currently inserted into groups.
