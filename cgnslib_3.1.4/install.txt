  Installation Instructions using cmake
(can also still use configure instead... see src/README.config)

1. Install HDF5 on your system

  (a) HDF5 uses the standard GNU autotools, so './configure', 
    'make', 'sudo make install' should install HDF5 without 
    problems on most systems.

2. Unpack the tar ball containing the source code into some 
  directory.

3. Create a new director in which to build the library.

4. Use cmake to initialize the build tree.

  user@hostname:build_path$ cmake /path/to/cgns/sources/


5. Use ccmake to edit the control variables as needed.

  user@hostname:build_path$ ccmake .


  (a) The paths to the HDF5 libraries and header files must be 
    set in 'HDF5_LIBRARY_DIR' and 'HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR' 
    respectively.

    i. If HDF5 is built with parallel-IO support via MPI, the 
      'HDF5_NEEDS_MPI' flag must be set to true.

    ii. If HDF5 is built with zlib and szip support, these need 
      to be flagged with 'HDF5_NEEDS_ZLIB' and 'HDF5_NEEDS_SZIP' 
      as well as the paths for those libraries.

  (b) Fortran can be enabled by toggling the 'ENABLE_FORTRAN' 
    variable.

    i. A view of the attempt to autodetect the correct interface 
      between Fortran and C is show, setting the value of 
      'FORTRAN_NAMING'.

    ii. For gfortran and pgf90 the value of 'FORTRAN_NAMING' 
      shoud be 'LOWERCASE_'.

  (c) The build system must be reconfigured after variable 
    changes by pressing 'c'. Variables who's value has changed 
    are maked with a '*' in the interface.

  (d) After configuration, the Makefiles must be generated by 
    pressing 'g'.

6. Use make to build the library.

  user@hostname:build_path$ make


  (a) A colorized review of the build process should follow.

7. Installation of the library is accomplished with the 'install' 
  target of the makefile.

  user@hostname:build_path$ make install


  (a) You must have permissions to alter the directory where cgns 
    will be installed.
