<h2>
<font color="#000066">Node Data</font></h2>
This panel displays the data associated with a node, and allows editing
of the data. The panel is a simple text editor, and really only intended
to be used to edit small amounts of data.
<p>The panel is filled in automatically when selecting a node from the
<a href="nodetree.html">Node Tree</a> if <a href="menu.html#ConfigMenu">Auto
Load Data</a> is enabled and the size of the the data is less than the
<a href="menu.html#ConfigMenu">Auto Data Size</a> threshold. A read of
the data may also be forced using the <a href="buttons.html">Read button</a>.
<p>In the case of multidimensional arrays, the data will shown in groups
of the inner dimension, with successive groups on a new line. In order
to prevent very long lines, which may cause a problem for the editor, the
number of data values to be displayed per line is limited to a maximum
value (default 10). This maximum value may be changed from the <a href="menu.html#ConfigMenu">Auto
Data Size</a> setup window. The current value may also be changed by typing
the new value in the <b>Values/Line</b> entry box, followed by the <i>Enter</i>
key.
<p>The current line containing the insertion cursor is shown in the <b>Line</b>
box. You may enter a new line number, followed by the <i>Enter</i> key
to go to the line. This entry accepts arithmetic expressions, so you may
type an expression like 75/3+1 to go to the line containing the 75th data
value. The number in parenthesis following the line number is the number
of the data value which is first on the current line.
<p>The data in the following figure is dimensioned (3,60) and so is shown
as 60 lines of 3 values each, and the cursor is currently on the 7th line,
which contains data values 19, 20 and 21.

<p>When formatting the data for display, the C "%g" format is used for
real data and the "%d" format for integer data. When converting the data
for writing to the node, the C routines atof() and atoi() are used for
real and integer data, respectively. Character data is treated as C strings.
<p>When creating a new node with the <a href="buttons.html">Create</a>
button, the data values in this panel, will be used to assign data to the
node. When modifying an existing node with the <a href="buttons.html">Modify</a>
button, these values will be used if they exist, otherwise the actual node
data is used. When doing data type conversions, this panel should generally
be cleared of data. Therefore, the program will automatically clear this
panel when the <b>Data Type</b> on the <a href="datadesc.html">Data Description</a>
panel is changed. The <a href="buttons.html">Read</a> button may be used
to reload the existing data if desired.
<p>When the <b>Node Label</b> in the <a href="nodedesc.html">Node Description</a>
panel is a known CGNS type, clicking Mouse Button 3 in this window will
pop-up a panel which lists the data properties associated with the CGNS
label type. If there is predefined data associated with the CGNS label
type, then a list of these values will be presented instead, allowing selection
of one of the predefined types.
