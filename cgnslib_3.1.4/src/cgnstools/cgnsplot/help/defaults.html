<td>This panel sets up the initial behavior and colors to be used when
reading in a CGNS file.
<p>The first section, <b>Display Tree</b>, controls the display of connecting
lines and color boxes within the Display Tree.
<p>The next section, <b>Volume Mesh</b>, indicates how the boundaries of
the volume mesh for each zone are to be treated. The default is to show
them as outlines.
<p>The initialization for the surface regions are set in the <b>Regions</b>
section, and the default for these is to display them as mesh lines but
with the visibility initially off.
<p>The <b>Colors</b> section defines the colors to be used initially for
the zones. The colors may be changed by clicking on the <b>Select</b> button.
New colors may be added with the <b>Add</b> button, and colors removed
with the <b>Remove</b> button. The <b>Default</b> button resets everything
to the default values.
