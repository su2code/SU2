<p>This panel defines and controls the display of a cutting plane. The
first section, <b>Color</b>, defines the color and transparency of the
cutting plane positioner, as shown in the image to the right.
<p>The second section, <b>Cut Plane</b>, controls the location of the cutting
plane. The <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <i>Z Directions</i> are the components
of the cutting plane normal, and the <i>Offset</i> is the distance along
the normal. The <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <i>Z Cut</i> buttons will initialize
the cutting plane normal to the specified axis, and in the middle of the
bounding box. The <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <u>Z</u> <i>Rotate</i> sliders
will rotate the plane about the corresponding axis, and the <i>Translate</i>
slider translates the plane along it's current normal. Lastly, the <i>Center</i>
button will center the plane in the middle of the bounding box. The cutting
plane is clipped the the bounding box, which is either that of the visible
objects or the entire model if the <i>Ignore Region Visibility</i> button
is checked (see below).
<p>In the image to the right, the cutting plane was first located by using
the <i>X Cut</i> button and computed, then repositioned using the <i>Y
Cut</i> button. Entering <i>Compute</i> now will remove the previous cutting
plane results, and recompute it at the new location.
<p>The last section, <b>Display</b>, controls how the cut elements will
be displayed. <i>Off</i> disables display of the cut elements; <i>Planar</i>
displays the intersect of the cut elements as lines in the plane; and <i>Elements</i>
and <i>Shaded</i> display the cut elements as either a wireframe or shaded
surfaces. The cut elements will either be colored by the region colors
or by the cutplane positioner color, depending on whether <i>Use Cutplane
Color</i> is enabled. If <i>Ignore Region Visibility</i> is enabled, then
all elements will be intersected and displayed, regardless of whether they
are actually visible or not.
<p>When the cutting plane has been positioned, the <i>Compute</i> button
or the <i>Enter</i> key will compute and display the cutting plane. The
<i>Defaults</i> button will reset everything to the defaults, and the <i>Close</i>
button will close the panel and remove the cut plane.
