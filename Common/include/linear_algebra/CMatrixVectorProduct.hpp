 * \class CMatrixVectorProduct

 * \brief Abstract base class for defining matrix-vector products
 * \author J. Hicken.
 *
 * The Krylov-subspace solvers require only matrix-vector products and
 * not the actual matrix/Jacobian.  We need some way to indicate which
 * function will perform the product.  However, sometimes the
 * functions that define the product will require different numbers
 * and types of inputs.  For example, the forward-difference
 * approximation to a Jacobian-vector product requires the vector that
 * defines the Jacobian and a perturbation parameter.  The
 * CMatrixVectorProduct class is used to derive child classes that can
 * handle the different types of matrix-vector products and still be
 * passed to a single implementation of the Krylov solvers.
 * This abstraction may also be used to define matrix-free products.
