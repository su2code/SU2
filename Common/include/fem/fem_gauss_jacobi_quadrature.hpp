Dear Thomas Economon,

Thank you for your note about jacobi_rule.cpp; I am glad you find it of use.

You are welcome to use this code in any way you choose.

The only reason I put a Gnu LGPL on it was because, from a number of inquiries,
it became clear to me that people were hesitant to use a piece of software if
there was no license information on it at all.  At the time, LGPL seemed the least
restrictive.  I didn't pay attention to the vexing fact that now there are several
versions of LGPL, because I really don't care.

If this statement is not enough for you, let me know what would be better.
I have no objection to you taking a copy of jacobi_rule.cpp and altering the
license to agree with your preferred version of LGPL, for instance.

John Burkardt

Dear John,

I am the lead developer for the open-source SU2 suite, which is primarily for
computational fluid dynamics, but also for solving other PDE systems
(http://su2.stanford.edu, https://github.com/su2code/SU2). Over the past few months,
we have been working on a new high-order discontinuous Galerkin fluid solver within
the codebase, led by Prof. Edwin van der Weide at the University of Twente (cc’d).

We found your attached code to be very helpful in resolving some issues with integration
for our pyramid elements, and we would really like to reuse the implementation if possible.
First, we would like to check if this is ok with you personally, and ask how we can
properly attribute your work in the code? Second, we are curious just what version of the
GNU LGPL license you are using to make sure that we don’t have any licensing issues.
For SU2, we are using GNU LGPL v2.1.

Thanks for the time and take care,
Tom
