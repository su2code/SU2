 * \file tracy_structure.hpp
 * \brief Tracy profiler interface header.
 *        Provides compatibility macros if the code is built without
 *        tracy support. Profiling macros are defined here so that
 *        they can be completely "disabled" when compiling without tracy.
 * \note Do not include tracy headers explicitly anywhere, use this header instead.
 * \note To enable tracy, define the TRACY_ENABLE macro during compilation.
