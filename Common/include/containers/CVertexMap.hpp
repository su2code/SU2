/*!
 * \class CVertexMap
 * \ingroup Containers
 * \brief A lookup type map, maps indices in a large range to indices in a smaller one.
 *
 * The usage case is:
 *   1 - Initialize via Reset for the large range size.
 *   2 - Use SetIsVertex to define what large range indices have small range correspondence.
 *   3 - Call Build, vertices are given a sequential index in increasing order of iPoint,
 *       not in order of calls to SetIsVertex. Keep this in mind when allocating vertex data.
 *   4 - Use GetVertexIndex to convert a point index to vertex index.
 *
 * Only consider using this class if you have no reasonable way to keep track of vertices.
 * For example if you need to assume every point might be a vertex, but you do not want to
 * allocate data for the entire set of points.
 *
 * \note For efficiency use the smallest type that can fit the maximum number of vertices.
