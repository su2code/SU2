 * \mainpage SU2 version 7.0.1 "Blackbird"
 * SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software tools
 * to perform PDE analysis and PDE constrained optimization problems.  The toolset is designed with 
 * computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to
 * include other families of governing equations such as potential flow, electrodynamics, chemically reacting
 * flows, and many others.  SU2 is released under an
 * open-source license.
 * 
 * The following technical documentation describes the structure and details of the source code for developers.
