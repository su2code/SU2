 * \mainpage The SU$^2$ Suite
 * The Stanford University Unstructured (SU$^2$) suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software tools
 * to perform PDE analysis and PDE constrained optimization problems.  The toolset is designed with 
 * computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to
 * include other families of governing equations such as potential flow, electrodynamics, chemically reacting
 * flows, and many others.  SU$^2$ is under active development at 
 * <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</A> in the
 * <A HREF="http://adl.stanford.edu/">Aerospace Design Lab (ADL)</A> of the 
 * <A HREF="http://aa.stanford.edu/">Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</A> and is released under an
 * open-source license.
 * 
 * The following technical documentation describes the structure and details of the source code for developers. 
 * To read the more general documentation, including an introduction to the suite, user and developer guides and the latest 
 * releases for downloading, please click <A HREF="http://adl.stanford.edu/docs/display/SUSQUARED/SU2+Home">here</A>.
