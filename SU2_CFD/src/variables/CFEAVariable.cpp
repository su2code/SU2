  /*--- This simplifies the discrete adjoint of this solver, as it allows an abstract
   * treatment of the "state" (disp. vel. accel.) whose details are only important
   * for the primal solver. In time domain the primal "believes" it has nVar variables,
   * which it uses for linear solvers, and then handles velocity and acceleration
   * explicitly (for time integration). Whereas the discrete adjoint "thinks" the
   * primal solution has 3*nVar variables. This is a little different from simply
   * giving names to parts of the solution, it requires the methods of CVariable that
   * deal with adjoints to deduce "nVar" from the container, rather than relying on
   * the nVar member (which is manipulated above, so that CVariable::SetSolution, etc.
   * still work as expected for the primal solver). ---*/
