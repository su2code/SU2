## We used to define this.  However, we don't because vendor makes
## (e.g., Solaris, Irix) won't correctly propagate variables that are
## defined in Makefile.  This particular variable can't be correctly
## defined by configure (at least, not the current configure), so we
## simply avoid defining it to allow the user to use this feature with
## a vendor make.

## Shell code that determines whether make is running in "dry mode"
## ("make -n") or not.  Useful in rules that invoke make recursively,
## and are thus executed also with "make -n" -- either because they
## are declared as dependencies to '.MAKE' (NetBSD make), or because
## their recipes contain the "$(MAKE)" string (GNU and Solaris make).

## misinterpret that as and indication that make is running in dry mode.
